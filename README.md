# Tic Tac Toe

Tic Tac Toe is a timeless game, and this implementation brings it into the digital era. Designed for web play, it uses modern web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the Bootstrap framework to create a responsive and interactive experience.

## Features

- **Single-Player Mode**: Play against an automated opponent that makes moves at random.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with Bootstrap to look great on both desktop and mobile screens.
- **Interactive Board**: A simple click interface for placing your X's or O's on the game board.

## Rules of the Game

- The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
- You are X, and your opponent (the computer) is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
- The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
- If all 9 squares are filled and no player has 3 marks in a row, the game is considered a draw.

## Built With

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - The CSS framework used for styling and to make the design responsive
- HTML - The markup language used to structure and present content on the web
- CSS - The style sheet language used to describe the presentation of the HTML document
- JavaScript - The scripting language used to implement the game logic
